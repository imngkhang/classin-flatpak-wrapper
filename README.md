# ClassIn unofficial Flatpak wrapper

## Description

This is an unofficial Flatpak wrapper for ClassIn. 

Since ClassIn only officially provides `.deb` packages (which cannot be installed directly on Red Hat, SUSE, Arch, Gentoo-based, or immutable Linux distributions), this wrapper packages and extracts the official `.deb` binaries directly within the Flatpak sandbox.

## ⚠️ Known Issues
  - **Screen sharing does not work on Wayland:** This is an upstream issue from ClassIn (EEO). The client lacks `libqwayland.so` implementation, resulting in a black screen when attempting to share. A temporary workaround is running your session on X11.
  
If you encounter any other issues, please report them on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/imngkhang/classin-flatpak-wrapper/issues).
